# OVerlord – Three.js Computer Graphics Project

## Project Overview
**OVerlord** is a 3D computer graphics project built using the **Three.js** library.  
The project showcases a dark fantasy scene featuring a **Dark Warrior** and a **giant battle hamster** inside an interactive 3D environment.

This project was developed as part of a **Computer Graphics** course, with an emphasis on 3D scene construction, object modeling, lighting techniques, texture mapping, user interaction, and animation using WebGL and JavaScript.

## Technologies
- Three.js
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- WebGL
- HTML & CSS
- GLTF Loader
- OrbitControls

---

## Key Features
- Interactive 3D fantasy scene
- Dark Warrior character with movement and rotation controls
- Magical spell circle with dynamic lighting and toggle functionality
- Hamster model constructed using geometric primitives
- Raycasting interaction for texture switching
- Skybox implemented using cube mapping
- 3D text rendered using TextGeometry
- Multiple light sources with shadow support

---

## User Controls
- **W / S** – Move forward / backward  
- **A / D** – Move left / right  
- **Q / E** – Rotate left / right  
- **Space** – Toggle spell effect  
- **Mouse Click** – Toggle hamster face texture  
- **Mouse Drag** – Orbit camera

## Lighting System
- Ambient Light for global illumination
- Directional Light for directional shading
- Spotlight for focused lighting
- Point Light for magical spell effect
